# platformer_game
Hi! This is my first game! Dont expect too much its just a platformer game. I followed Florian's 2d guide on youtube(https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow). It was fun, he is a very talented person, easy to understand every explaination he did in his videos.
It was good for me to learn the basics of scripting and moving around in unity,my plans for this game to maximize what I can do. More info in the release commits.
